# coursera_nlp_deeplearning.ai

Contains the material of coursera natural language processing specialization by deeplearning.ai.

The repo contains the code for the courses:
- [Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/sequence-models-in-nlp)
- [Natural Language Processing with Attention Models](https://www.coursera.org/learn/attention-models-in-nlp?)

The material is organized with respect to the weeks in labs and assignements, which are all solved

# Set up
The course uses trax as Machine Learning library for sequential models. At the state of creation of this repo. The underlying dependecy of trax, jax is only available for linux machines. Therefore, it is recommanded, to run the notebooks with google colab.
